/**
 * \brief A radio-button like widget retaining a pressed state once pressed.
 *
 * \note: The way this works right now is not that nice. It's however made so it can work nicely with Blender.
 *
 * Normally, there's a group of radio buttons, once one of them is pressed, the others get un-pressed. It's an
 * exclusive behavior: There should only ever be one pressed radio button in the group. bWidgets doesn't
 * ensure this behavior at all as of now. The host application needs to do this.
 * In future, there should be a group-widget that ensures the exclusive behavior within bWidgets. We need to
 * make Blender ready for it first, though (or make it optional).
