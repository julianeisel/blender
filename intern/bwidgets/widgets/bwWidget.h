/**
 * Try to dynamically cast a widget from one widget type to another. Use-case is not just to
 * perform the cast itself, but to also to check if a widget is of a specific type.
 *
 * There are a couple of reasons why types are checked this way:
 * * Using \ref bwWidget::identifier for this would imply string comparisons - which scale badly.
 * * The most practical alternative would probably be a type enum. To add a widget, the central
 *   enum definition would have to be extended. This makes it impossible to define a widget in a
 *   single file.
 * * Enums can't be modified from external code to define custom widget types (types not definied
 *   within bWidgets). So for these a "custom" enum item would be needed. If this is set, an
 *   alternative type check mechanism would be needed, likely the slower string comparison.
 * * Using enums leads to more verbose and less safe checks. If an enum value says the widget is of
 *   a certain type, the code will assume it was also constructed for this type. It typically
 *   performs a static cast, which may work fine in most cases, but is technically unsafe still.
 *   Using `dynamic_cast<>()`, the compiler ensures a type-safe operation.
 *
 * Retains const-correctness and always returns a pointer. E.g. `widget_cast<bwFoo>(const_object)`
 * returns a `const bwFoo*` type.
 *
 * \note By design, bWidgets should not need much type casting or type checking like this. Widget
 *       types, composed together with other custom objects (like widget specific event handlers)
 *       through the screen-graph node, should be able to define comprehensive custom behavior.
 *       Sometimes it's still necessary to customize behavior through type checks from outside the
 *       widget type definition though. At least for now.
 *
 * \return The derrived widget class of type `T*` or `nullptr` if cast is not valid (whereby T is
 *         the "raw" type requested, without pointer).
